  Description:    This file contains user configurable variables for the BLE
                  Controller and Host. This file is also used for defining the
                  type of RF Front End used with the TI device, such as using
                  a Differential front end with External Bias, etc. Please see
                  below for more detail.

                  To change the default values of configurable variables:
                    - Include the followings in your application main.c file:
                      #ifndef USE_DEFAULT_USER_CFG

                      #include "bleUserConfig.h"

                      // BLE user defined configuration
                      bleUserCfg_t user0Cfg = BLE_USER_CFG;

                      #endif // USE_DEFAULT_USER_CFG
                    - Set the preprocessor symbol MAX_NUM_BLE_CONNS, MAX_NUM_PDU,
                      MAX_PDU_SIZE, L2CAP_NUM_PSM or L2CAP_NUM_CO_CHANNELS
                      to a desired value in your application project.
                    - Include "bleUserConfig.h" in your stack OSAL_ICallBle.c
                      file.
                    - Call setBleUserConfig at the start of stack_main. Actually,
                      it is okay to set the variables anywhere in stack_main as
                      long as it is BEFORE osal_init_system, but best to set at
                      the very start of stack_main.

                  Note: User configurable variables are only used during the
                        initialization of the Controller and Host. Changing
                        the values of these variables after this will have no
                        effect.

                  Note: To use the default user configurable variables, define
                        the preprocessor symbol USE_DEFAULT_USER_CFG in your
                        application project.

                  For example:
                    - In your application main.c, include:
                      #ifndef USE_DEFAULT_USER_CFG

                      #include "bleUserConfig.h"

                      // BLE user defined configuration
                      bleUserCfg_t user0Cfg = BLE_USER_CFG;
                      #endif // USE_DEFAULT_USER_CFG
                    - In your application project, set the preprocessor symbol
                      MAX_NUM_BLE_CONNS to 1 to change the maximum number of BLE
                      connections to 1 from the default value of 3.
                    - In your stack OSAL_ICallBle.c file, call setBleUserCfg to
                      update the user configuration variables:
                      #include "bleUserConfig.h"
                      :
                      int stack_main( void *arg )
                      {
                        setBleUserConfig( (bleUserCfg_t *)arg );
                        :
                      }

                  Default values:
                    maxNumConns     : 3
                    maxNumPDUs      : 6
                    maxPduSize      : 27
                    maxNumPSM       : 3
                    maxNumCoChannels: 3

// Device Package and Evaluation Module (EM) Board
//
// The CC26xx device comes in three types of packages: 7x7, 5x5, 4x4.
// For each package, the user may change how the RF Front End (FE) is
// configured. The possible FE settings are provided as a set of defines.
// (The user can also set the FE bias, the settings of which are also provided
// as defines.) The user can change the value of RF_FE_MODE_AND_BIAS to
// configure the RF FE as desired. However, while setting the FE configuration
// determines how the device is configured at the package, it is the PCB the
// device is mounted on (the EM) that determines how those signals are routed.
// So while the FE is configurable, how signals are used is fixed by the EM.
// As can be seen, the value of RF_FE_MODE_AND_BIAS is organized by the EM
// board as defined by EMs produced by Texas Instruments Inc. How the device
// is mounted, routed, and configured for a user product would of course be
// user defined, and the value of RF_FE_MODE_AND_BIAS would have to be set
// accordingly; the user could even dispense with the conditional board
// compiles entirely. So too with the usage of the Tx Power tables. As can be
// seen in bleUserConfig.c, there are two tables, one for packages using a
// differential FE, and one for single-end. This too has been organized by TI
// defined EMs and would have to be set appropriately by the user.
//
// For example:
// Let's say you decided to build several boards using the CC26xx 4x4 package.
// For one board, you plan to use a differential RF FE, while on the other you
// wish to use a single ended RFN RF FE. You would then create your own board.h
// (located by your preprocessor Include path name) that contains one of two
// defines that you create (say MY_CC26xx_4ID and MY_CC26xx_4XS). Then you can
// define your own choice of RF FE conditionally based on these defines
// (completely replacing those shown below), as follows:
//
//#if defined( MY_CC26xx_4ID )
//
//  #define RF_FE_MODE_AND_BIAS           ( RF_FE_DIFFERENTIAL |               \
//                                          RF_FE_INT_BIAS )
//#elif defined( MY_CC26xx_4XS )
//
//  #define RF_FE_MODE_AND_BIAS           ( RF_FE_SINGLE_ENDED_RFN |           \
//                                          RF_FE_EXT_BIAS )
//#else // unknown device package
// :
//
// In this way, you can define your own board I/O settings, and configure your
// RF FE based on your own board defines.
//
// For additional details and examples, please see the Software Developer's
// Guide.
